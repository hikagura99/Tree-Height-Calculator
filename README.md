# Tree-Height-Calculator
Exercise from chapter 2 of Beginning C by Morris and Horton, with a few updates, to calculate the height of a tree using the height of two people and the distance between them and the tree.

Things I added:
* Support for both imperial and metric systems;
* Conversion from one system to the other at the end;
* String comparing to check the choice made;
* An error message in case the distance is set to 0.

If you stumble upon here, feel free to make suggestions (and please explain them to me I'm still learning lol).
